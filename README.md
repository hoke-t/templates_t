## Inspiration
In many cases, the code is inspired by (and often taken directly from) the following sources:
* [Neal Wu's competitive-programming repository](https://github.com/nealwu/competitive-programming)
* [KACTL](https://github.com/kth-competitive-programming/kactl)
* [ecnerwala's cp-book](https://github.com/ecnerwala/cp-book)
* and probably other places!
